NOTES APPLICATION 

This is a notes application which is built completely over the backend with no front end user interface.
All the functionalities of the app have to accesed from the terminal as it does not support user interface of any kind.

The application has multiple functions as listed below:
- Add a new note with tilte and body.
- Remove a existing note by passing in it's title. 
- List the title of all existing notes.
- Read the body contents of an existing note by passing in it's title.

The Source Code is in the app.js file which calls the note.js file to perform all the functions.
Another file named as notes.json files is formed where all the notes added/deleted are stored in the JSON format.

The entire code is written in JavaScript by using Node.js functionality.
